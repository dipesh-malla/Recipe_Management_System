(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Recipe share is a full-stack web application

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,520
designed for users to share, save and get

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,980
personalized recommendations on recipes and also to explore

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,220
recipes and chefs worldwide.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,240
Now let's move to recipes tab.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,280
Recipes section consists of recommended for you recipes

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,460
and all recipes.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,500
All recipes consist of all the recipes data

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,180
from the database.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,160
We can filter it based on cuisine type,

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,300
labels and maximum cooking time.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,040
Let's explore one individual recipe.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,600
We can now like the recipe, save the

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,220
recipe and also share the recipe.

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,700
Let's listen to the audio.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,060
Let's now explore recommended for you section.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,980
Recommended for you section uses ml power recommendation

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,680
system to recommend to users.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,180
It uses three different type of ml models

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,860
for recommending.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
First one is the most powerful two-tower

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,900
neural network architecture such as in this system.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,520
It uses two different towers such as user

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,340
and recipe embeddings and calculates similarity between these

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,180
two and recommends similar recipes to the users.

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,240
Second one is alternative least squares method.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
This method computes nested factorization between user to

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,520
item embeddings and recommends similar items to the

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,780
users.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,920
Third one is popularity-based method.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,260
This method simply recommends popular recipes and popular

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,740
shapes to the users directly.

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,980
This is the feed section.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,380
Your users can explore feed and also post

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,040
their updates directly with images.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,930
Here is the discover tab and your user

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,150
can discover top trending recipes and chefs.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,340
Here is the chefs tab.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,780
Your user can discover all of the chefs

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,580
and also get personalized recommendation of chefs.

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
User can also follow other chefs and also

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,560
they can filter out chefs based on most

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,180
recipes or most followers.

44
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,060
The recommended for you chefs that is the

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,780
personalized recommendation for user works similar to that

46
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,720
of recommended for recipes section.

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,980
Here is the notification where user get notification

48
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,720
and here is the messages page where user

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,540
can message to their specific mutual connections.

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,460
This is the specific user profile page where

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,340

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,420
well.

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,380
This is the search bar in our website

55
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,680
where user can search for specific item recipes

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,520
or cuisine types.

57

They can fill in this information, can also

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,480
upload an image and then submit the recipe.

60
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,280
After submitting the recipe, the new recipe will

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,100
appear in their profile page such as this

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,740
ice cake.
